	* BufferUtil.java (Repository): apply patch from from Robert
	Schuster <theBohemian@gmx.net>
	
	The big buffer holding all the data of the smaller ones was not
	correctly set into the state where the data could be read afterwards.

	This caused a buffer overflow. Well, just flipping the buffer state
	fixes this.

	Along with this small fix I changed the minimum buffer size to 8192 (was
	1024) which will cause the creation of fewer intermediate buffer for big
	files.

	* BufferUtil.java (Repository): revent change which called
	ByteBufferPool to get any buffer.

	* BufferUtil.java (Repository): add createFloatBuffer() method

	* BufferUtil.java (Repository): changed readInputStream() so that
	when it created the ByteBuffer to ordering is set to the native
	byte order.
	
	* BufferUtil.java (Repository): integrated patch from Robert
	Schuster <theBohemian@gmx.net> which fixed the problem of loading
	byte streams from URLs over the network.  Thanks Robert!
