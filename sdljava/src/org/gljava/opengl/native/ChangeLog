	* glu.i (Repository): removed the following functions because they
	do not resolve on windows and break the build.  Should investigate
	how to offer these on where they are available (as in linux...):
		gluBuild1DMipmapLevels 
		gluBuild2DMipmapLevels
		gluBuild3DMipmapLevels
		gluBuild3DMipmaps
		gluCheckExtension
		gluUnProject4

	* opengl-1_1_arrays.i (Repository): okay really do use java_arrays.i

	* opengl-1_1_arrays.i (Repository): don't use swig java_arrays.i
	library.  Let swig use its default.

	* glew.i (Repository): do not call SWIG_glew_init.  Client must
	now do this at appropriate time.

	* glew.i (Repository): removed extern from function prototypes as
	it wasn't needed and was messing up VC++.

	* glew.i (Repository): removed include of GL.h.  No need for it
	and it can confuse some compiliers due to symbol redefinition.

2005-01-30  Ivan Z. Ganza  <ivan_ganza@yahoo.com>

	* glew.i (Repository): added ability to disable loading of
	shared library via -Dsdljava.bootclasspath value  or
	-Dgljava.bootclasspath (any value prevents loading of shared libs)
