Version 0.4.0
=============
* Added a fix to make both versions of drawImage in
  OpenGLGraphics and SDLGraphics visible and usable.
* Optimized fillRect in SDLGraphics slightly when using alpha
  blending. However, SDLGraphics still needs a lot of optimizing
  in other parts.
* Updated ImageFont with support for font images with several rows
  of glyphs.
* Added modal focus to widgets. Widgets can now request modal focus
  stealing all input from other widgets. Can be useful when making
  dialog windows.
* Many small fixes.
