* added jniclasscode pragma's to swig interface (.i) files  which call
  System.loadLibrary for the appropriate lib.  Now there is no need to
  call System.loadLibrary explictly from code which utilizes sdljava

* added new methods to SDLMixer (SDLMixer version requirement is still
  1.2.5)
	public static MixChunk loadWAV(Buffer buf) throws SDLException
	public static MixChunk loadWAV(byte[] data) throws SDLException
	public static MixChunk loadWAV(URL url) throws SDLException, IOException, MalformedURLException
	public static MixChunk loadWAV(InputStream in) throws SDLException, IOException

	public static MixMusic loadMUS(Buffer buf) throws SDLException {
	public static MixMusic loadMUS(byte[] data) throws SDLException
	public static MixMusic loadMUS(URL url) throws SDLException, IOException, MalformedURLException
	public static MixMusic loadMUS(InputStream in) throws SDLException, IOException
	
* added new methods to SDLImage
	public static SDLSurface load(Buffer buf) throws SDLException
	public static SDLSurface load(byte[] data) throws SDLException
	public static SDLSurface load(URL url) throws SDLException, IOException, MalformedURLException
	public static SDLSurface load(InputStream in ) throws SDLException, IOException

* JDK 1.5 enumerations removed.  Any existing code which used these
  enumerations needs to be slightly modified.  Please see tests for 
  examples of how to use.

    * CDStatus.java       is no longer a JDK 1.5 enumeration
    * SDLGrabMode.java    is no longer a JDK 1.5 enumeration
    * SDLAppState.java    is no longer a JDK 1.5 enumeration
    * SDLEventAction.java is no longer a JDK 1.5 enumeration
    * SDLEventState.java  is no longer a JDK 1.5 enumeration
    * SDLKey.java         is no longer a JDK 1.5 enumeration
    * SDLEvent.java
    	method eventState now takes an int for the event type
    	method getKeyName now takes an int
    	method getType now returns an int
	
* ALL JDK 1.5 dependencies removed.  JDK 1.5 is no longer required!!

* OpenGL 1.1 Support added!!!
    * new methods on SDLSurface getGL() and glSwapBuffers() to access

* BufferUtil.java changed readInputStream() so that when it created
  the ByteBuffer to ordering is set to the native byte order.

* SDLSurface added mustLock() method

* BufferUtil.java: integrated patch from Robert Schuster
  <theBohemian at gmx.net> which fixed the problem of loading byte
  streams from URLs over the network.  Thanks Robert!

* SDLSurface added ByteBuffer getPixelData() method which returns
  direct byte buffer for pixel data access!  Removed
  get/setPixelDataXXXX() methods

* FTGL binding added (http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/henryj/code/#FTGL).  
  Font support is now available for OpenGL binding.  Check out FTGLTest example code.

* Moved gljava and ftgl build to src/org/gljava/opengl/native directory

* Added ability to disable automatic loading of shared library.
  Specify -Dsdljava.bootclasspath=true (or any value) to the java vm
  and no shared  libraries will be loaded.  
  Thanks to Stéphane Meslin-Weber <steph at tangency.co.uk> for the
  suggestions.

* added org.gljava.opengl.model package to faciliate dealing with 3D
  model data.  Also added gljava_export.py blender export script which
  exports xml format file which can be imported by XMLModelLoader in
  same pacakge.  (there is much to be done here stil...)

* added DebugGL for debug pipeline support.  Please see source file
  for documentatin.

* Changed methods in SDLGfx which took short[] to take ShortBuffer
instances instead.  Note:  these methods are currently not working.

* added version API; SDLMain.getSDLVersion(), SDLMixer.getMixVersion(), SDLTTF.getTTFVersion()
