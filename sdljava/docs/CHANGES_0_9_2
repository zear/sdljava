	* adjusted SDLSurface.freeSurface() due to memory leak located
	by Patric Rufflarp

2006-03-13:
	* added code to implement the following YUV methods to SDLVideo class:
	    SDLOverlay createYUVOverlay(int width, int height, int format, SDLSurface display) throws SDLException 
	    int lockYUVOVerlay(SDLOverlay overlay) {
            int displayYUVOverlay(SDLOverlay overlay, SDLRect rect)
            void freeYUVOverlay(SDLOverlay overlay)	

2005-09-25:
	* removed the following methods from gljava because they do not resolve on windows:
		gluBuild1DMipmapLevels 
		gluBuild2DMipmapLevels
		gluBuild3DMipmapLevels
		gluBuild3DMipmaps
		gluCheckExtension
		gluUnProject4

2005-09-16:
	* add native array methods to gljava code.  One exists for each 
	method which takes an NIO buffer (except for void *)

2005-09-14:
	* added method GlewImpl.init() -- use this to initialize library if required.

2005-09-03:
	* removed call to SWIG_glew_init() in static initializer for GLEW (gljava)

	* update guichan to latest 0.4.0 via code from Rainer.  Thanks Rainer!

2005-05-26:
	* integrated guichan  (http://guichan.sourceforge.net/) port by 
	  Rainer Koschnick.  Thanks Rainer!

2005-02-23:
	* imported FREE javax.math package from
	      http://www.objectclub.jp/download/vecmath_e.  
	  Thanks to Kenji Hiranabe <hiranabe at esm.co.jp> for
	  providing this!

2005-03-01:
	* fixed common.i typemap, it was using (void * buf) but should
	  have been (void *).  This resulted in the typemap not being
          generated unless the prototype was matching (void * buf)

2005-03-13:
	* integrated patch from Chris Dennett (Dessimat0r at ntlworld.com) 
	  which added SDLPoint and enhanced SDLRect

2005-03-23:
	* added GLU support

2005-03-28:
	* integrated patch from Chris Dennett (Dessimat0r at ntlworld.com) 
	  which enhanced SDLPoint, SDLRect and SDLSurface.

2005-05-26:
	* guichan port checked into CVS (Thanks Rainer!).

2005-07-08:
	* added setPixelDataXXXX() and getPixelDataXXXX() methods to
	  SDLSurface

2005-07-13:
	* SDLEventManager.java:  applied fix from Stefan Prelle
          to the register method.  Line 108 should have been:
                if (!SDLEvent.class.isAssignableFrom(eventType)) return false;
