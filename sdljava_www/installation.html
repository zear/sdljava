INSTALL
==================
NOTE:  PLEASE MAKE SURE you already have the dependencies installed on
your system.
     - Java 1.5
     - SDL 1.2.7
     
     - SDL_image 1.2.3 (optional)
     - SDL_mixer 1.2.5 (optional)
     - SDL_ttf 2.0.6   (optional)

     - Ant 1.6.2       (optional, only if you need to compile
		       sdljava.jar)
     - ruby 1.8.2      (optional, only if you want to re-generate
		       native layer)
     - SWIG 1.3.22     (optional, only if you want to re-generate
		       native layer)
		     

USING INCLUDED BINARIES (BINARY RELEASE)
==================
	The required libraries will already be present in the lib
directory and you may simply begin to use then.  Skip to the usage
section below.


COMPILE FROM SOURCES (SOURCE RELEASE/CVS)
==================
On any platform compilation consists of two steps.
   1) compile the native interface layer
   2) compile the java source files

UNIX:
	Compile Native Layer
	--------------------------------------------------

	To compile the native interface layer copy the Makefile from
	etc/build/linux

		$ cp etc/build/linux/Makefile src/sdljava/native

	Type make and see if the build works.  If not you most likely
	will need to add an additional include path based on the error
	message received.

	Note:  if you wish to build libsdljava_gfx invoke 
	"make libsdljava_gfx.so" as well.

	Once this completes with success you should have the shared
	libraries built depending on what you choose to build.
		  libsdljava.so
		  libsdljava_image.so
		  libsdljava_mixer.so
                  libsdljava_ttf.so
		  libsdljava_gfx.so

	The build should also have copied the libraries to the
	appropriate location in $(SDLJAVA)/lib.

	This is it for the native layer!

	Compile Java Layer
	--------------------------------------------------
	To compile the java layer invoke ant from the root like so:
	   $ ant jar
	
	This should result in the java source files being compiled and
	archived into the sdljava jarfile (sdljava.jar).  The jarfile
	will be played in $(SDLJAVA)/lib.

WINDOWS:
	Compile Native Layer
	--------------------------------------------------

	MinGW
	----------------------------------------------

	There is a makfile for MinGW located in
		\etc\build\windows\mingw

	To build under MinGW download first following the instructions
	posted here:
	       www.mingw.org
	       http://www.mingw.org/MinGWiki/index.php/GettingStarted?PHPSESSID=f79415c5bdbd257b2235286d0d17d48b

	First compile the required SDL libraries under MinGW then you
	will be able to run the provided makefile to build the sdljava
	dll files.

	Hint:  When you configure each package pass an appropriate
	value such as: 
	      ./configure --prefix=/c/dev/msys/1.0 (on my system at
						    least)
        This will make sure all the packages go to the appropriate
	place.

	VisualC
	----------------------------------------------
	There is a Makefile provided for building under a Visual C
	enviornment.  The Makefile may be found in
		\etc\build\windows\VisualC

	You will need to edit the makefile and do the following:

		** before you begin this process you need to have
		** already the SDL .dll and .lib files.  You can
		** download them from the SDL site itself or compile
		** them.  Each library has a -devel-XXX-VC6.zip
		** package which contains the .lib files.  Place all
		** the .lib files in the src/sdljava/native directory
		** so they can be resolved by the linker.

		1.  Set the appropriate value for TOOLS to point to
		    your VisualC install.

		2.  Set the appropriate value for JAVA_INCLUDE to
		    point to your java install

		3.  Copy the SDL header (.h) files into the
		    src/sdljava/native directory or set the include
		    path to point to them where they are on your
		    filesystem

		4.  Copy the SDL header of each API such as mixer,
		    ttf, etc... which you plan to use into the
		    src/sdljava/native directory or set the include
		    path to point to them where they are on your
		    filesystem.

		4.  Now you can build each module by running nmake
		    (make sure you run vcvars32.bat first)
		    Each target can be built with the following
		    command:
			nmake			- sdljava.dll
			nmake sdljava_image	- sdljava_image.dll
			nmake sdljava_mixer	- sdljava_mixer.dll
			nmake sdljava_ttf	- sdljava_ttf.dll
			nmake sdljava_gfx	- sdljava_gfx.dll
	

	Compile Java Layer
	--------------------------------------------------
	To compile the java layer invoke ant from the root like so:
	   $ ant jar
	
	This should result in the java source files being compiled and
	archived into the sdljava jarfile (sdljava.jar).  The jarfile
	will be played in $(SDLJAVA)/lib.


USAGE
==================
	After everything is compiled and nicely packaged up you can
write programs which utilize sdljava by doing two things:

      1)  include the native libraries (.so or .dll) files in the
          java.library.path with the appropriate switch to the java vm:
		    java -Djava.library.path=$(SDLJAVA)/lib

      2)  include the classes from sdljava in the classpath by either
          including the jarfile on the classpath or the classes
	  directory itself:
		    java -cp $(SDLJAVA)/lib/sdljava.jar
		      OR
		    java -cp $(SDLJAVA)/lib/classes

For example you can run the test for the video module like so:
	    java -Djava.library.path=./lib -cp ./classes/ sdljava.video.SDLVideoTest
	    
    NOTE:  You may also need to add lines like the following to load
    the native libaries:

    System.loadLibrary("sdljava"),
    System.loadLibrary("sdljava_mixer"), etc...

    sdljava is already making the calls to load the native libaries in
    static initializers however this appears to work only
    partly?...I'm not quite sure whats wrong, however, if you call
    loadLibrary your in a static initializer of your class all will be
    fine.






NOTES
==================
Linux:
	When configuring SDL Mixer the following switches needed to be passed to disable timidity
	SDL_mixer:
		./configure --disable-music-timidity-midi --disable-music-timidity-midi --disable-music-midi
